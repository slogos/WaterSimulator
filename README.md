# WaterSimulator

Mod1 is an algorithmic project made in Unity using C# and Javasript Languages. 
The project is about creating a terrestrial simulation followed by a hydrodynamic one.
At first, it will extrapolate from very restricted provided data a surface (more or
less realistic) representing a scene. Once that scene is defined, it will be covered with
water, in multiple shapes.
